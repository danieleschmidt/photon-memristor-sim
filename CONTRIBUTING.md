3. **Testing**: Complex changes require additional testing
4. **Documentation**: Updates must include relevant docs
5. **Performance**: Significant changes require benchmark validation

## Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests
```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    use approx::assert_relative_eq;

    #[test]
    fn test_waveguide_effective_index() {
        let waveguide = Waveguide::new(450e-9, 220e-9);
        let n_eff = waveguide.effective_index(1550e-9);
        assert_relative_eq!(n_eff, 2.4, epsilon = 1e-3);
    }
}
```

### Integration Tests
```python
def test_neural_network_training():
    """Test end-to-end neural network training."""
    pnn = PhotonicNeuralNetwork([784, 256, 10])
    
    # Generate synthetic data
    X_train = np.random.randn(100, 784)
    y_train = np.random.randint(0, 10, 100)
    
    # Train for a few epochs
    initial_loss = pnn.evaluate(X_train, y_train)
    pnn.train(X_train, y_train, epochs=5)
    final_loss = pnn.evaluate(X_train, y_train)
    
    assert final_loss < initial_loss
```

### Property-Based Testing
```rust
use proptest::prelude::*;

proptest! {
    #[test]
    fn waveguide_reciprocity(
        width in 200e-9..800e-9,
        height in 100e-9..400e-9,
        wavelength in 1200e-9..1700e-9
    ) {
        let wg = Waveguide::new(width, height);
        let forward = wg.propagate_forward(wavelength);
        let backward = wg.propagate_backward(wavelength);
        prop_assert_relative_eq!(forward.abs(), backward.abs(), epsilon = 1e-10);
    }
}
```

## Performance Guidelines

### Optimization Principles
1. **Measure First**: Profile before optimizing
2. **Algorithm Choice**: O(n) improvements beat micro-optimizations
3. **Memory Patterns**: Cache-friendly access patterns
4. **Parallelization**: Use Rayon for CPU, consider GPU for large problems
5. **SIMD**: Leverage nalgebra's SIMD support

### Benchmarking
```rust
use criterion::{black_box, criterion_group, criterion_main, Criterion};

fn benchmark_simulation(c: &mut Criterion) {
    let device = create_test_device();
    let input = create_test_input();
    
    c.bench_function("photonic_simulation", |b| {
        b.iter(|| device.simulate(black_box(&input)))
    });
}

criterion_group!(benches, benchmark_simulation);
criterion_main!(benches);
```
