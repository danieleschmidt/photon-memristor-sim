# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively maintain security updates for the following versions of photon-memristor-sim:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.1   | :x:                |

## Security Considerations

### Computational Security
- **Memory Safety**: Rust core eliminates buffer overflows and memory corruption vulnerabilities
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized before processing
- **Resource Limits**: Simulation parameters are bounded to prevent resource exhaustion attacks
- **Numerical Stability**: Calculations are protected against precision loss and overflow conditions

### Data Security
- **No Network Communication**: Core library operates entirely offline with no network dependencies
- **File System Access**: Limited to explicitly specified input/output paths with validation
- **Temporary Files**: Secure cleanup of temporary data and intermediate results
- **Memory Clearing**: Sensitive simulation data is zeroed before deallocation

### Dependency Security
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Conservative dependency policy to reduce attack surface
- **Regular Audits**: Automated security scanning of all dependencies
- **Version Pinning**: Explicit version control for all production dependencies
- **Supply Chain**: Verification of dependency integrity and provenance

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure.

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Installation Security
```bash
# Always install from official sources
pip install photon-memristor-sim

# Verify package integrity
pip install photon-memristor-sim --require-hashes

# Use virtual environments to isolate dependencies
python -m venv photonic_env
source photonic_env/bin/activate
pip install photon-memristor-sim
```

#### Data Handling
```python
import photon_memristor_sim as pms

# Validate input data ranges
def validate_input(data):
    if not isinstance(data, np.ndarray):
        raise ValueError("Input must be numpy array")
    if np.any(np.isnan(data)) or np.any(np.isinf(data)):
        raise ValueError("Input contains invalid values")
    if data.size > 1e8:  # 100M elements
        raise ValueError("Input data too large")
    return data

# Sanitize file paths
import os
def safe_file_path(path):
    # Resolve and validate paths
    path = os.path.abspath(path)
    # Ensure within allowed directories
    if not path.startswith("/allowed/data/path"):
        raise ValueError("Invalid file path")
    return path
```

#### Resource Management
```python
# Set reasonable simulation limits
config = pms.SimulationConfig(
    max_memory_gb=4,          # Limit memory usage
    max_simulation_time=300,  # 5-minute timeout
    max_devices=10000,        # Reasonable device count
    numerical_precision="f64" # Prevent precision attacks
)

# Monitor resource usage
import resource
resource.setrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_AS, (4 * 1024**3, -1))  # 4GB limit
```

// Use safe Rust practices
#![deny(unsafe_code)]
#![warn(
    missing_docs,
    rust_2018_idioms,

// Validate all inputs
pub fn simulate_device(params: &DeviceParams) -> Result<SimulationResult, Error> {
    // Validate parameter ranges
    if params.power < 0.0 || params.power > MAX_POWER {
        return Err(Error::InvalidParameter("Power out of range"));
    }
    
    // Check for numerical stability
    if params.wavelength <= 0.0 || !params.wavelength.is_finite() {
        return Err(Error::InvalidParameter("Invalid wavelength"));
    }
    
    // Bounded array allocations
    if params.array_size > MAX_ARRAY_SIZE {
        return Err(Error::InvalidParameter("Array size too large"));
    }
    
    // Safe computation...
}
```

#### Dependency Management
```toml
# Cargo.toml - Use specific versions
[dependencies]
nalgebra = "=0.32.3"     # Pin exact versions for security
num-complex = "=0.4.4"
serde = { version = "=1.0.195", features = ["derive"] }

# Regular security audits
[dependencies.cargo-audit]
version = "0.18"
```

#### Testing Security
```python
# Security-focused tests
def test_input_validation():
    """Test that invalid inputs are properly rejected."""
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        pms.simulate(power=-1.0)  # Negative power
        pms.simulate(wavelength=float('inf'))  # Invalid wavelength
        pms.simulate(array_size=int(1e10))  # Too large array

def test_resource_limits():
    """Test that resource limits are enforced."""
    with pytest.raises(MemoryError):
        pms.create_large_simulation(size=int(1e12))

def test_numerical_stability():
    """Test for numerical edge cases."""
    result = pms.simulate(power=1e-20)  # Very small values
    assert np.all(np.isfinite(result))
    assert not np.any(np.isnan(result))
```

- Time to patch security vulnerabilities
- Number of security issues found in code review
- Dependency vulnerability exposure time
- Security test coverage percentage

## Incident Response
